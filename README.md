Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure.
Azure Mobile Services: With Mobile Services, itâ€™s easy to rapidly build engaging cross-platform and native apps for iOS, Android, Windows or Mac, store app data in the cloud or on premises, authenticate users, send push notifications, as well as add a custom backend logic in C# or Node.js.
The project models a real-life situation, wherein an authority can monitor water-filters either by using a mobile app, desktop app or a web application. The system monitors the waterfilters in a real-time scenario and maintains logs.
